## 📊 KMeans Clustering with 3D Visualization:
Welcome to this project where we explore KMeans Clustering through an engaging 3D model visualization! This repository is a result of a hands-on session where I deep-dived into unsupervised learning techniques, focusing on clustering real-world datasets effectively.


## 🚀 Highlights:
✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Learned to clean and prepare data meticulously for optimal clustering performance.

✅ Unsupervised Learning with KMeans
Implemented the KMeans algorithm to group similar data points without prior labels.

✅ Optimal K Detection using Silhouette Method
Applied the Silhouette Method to determine the ideal number of clusters (K) — ensuring meaningful and well-separated groups.

✅ Stunning 3D Visualization
Brought the clusters to life using interactive 3D plots, giving an intuitive view of the model's performance and cluster separation.
